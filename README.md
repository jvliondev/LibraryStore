# LibraryStore

Created this "Create Your Own Library" website using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and minimal Bootstrap. 

I started off with a basic structure and implemented functionality for the most part then retooled my html and css to give it a more modern feel. 

Added functionality using JavaScript for the remove button, add a book modual that allows users to include a image url to the book that they would like to store along with the information. User can check if read. I later added a toggle switch with bootstrap so users can decide to change if needed. 

I added more implementations such as animation, to allow when clicking on the book itself, to open like a book and showcase the book info.
